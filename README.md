### Audit reports for the Cyfrin updraft solidity auditing course and codehawks first flights.

A few things to note about these reports:
- The course encourages a portfolio be created and this is my first steps towards creating an audit portfolio.
- I choose to use a simple finding format vs. a full-blown report because competetive audits are my immediate goal with private / professional audits coming later.
- The infrastructure used in the updraft course for generating reports is considerable (~6GB on MacOS) and my focus is on learning rather than self-promotion at this stage. My reporting workflow consists of: the initial report is written in vscode using markdown along side the tests and the codebase. The final markdown version is copied to Obsidian and a PDF generated from there. 
- These audit reports are not copied from the course, that is, I watched the course and then wrote my own findings and worked out the PoC code and tests rather than copying Patrick's work.
- These audit reports DO have gaps and are not 100% correct due to the previous point above.

The main drivers for me writing and publishing these reports are:  

0. Reporting is a key deliverable of any type of Pentest, Bug bounty or Auditing activity and writing good reports is hard and takes practice.
1. Timeboxing practice to "finish the audit" and move on. Publishing makes it feel like a final step has been taken and the audit is complete.
2. Practice writing the findings, find a format that works for me and start getting the names of vulns correct.
3. Practicing humility. These reports probably suck right now; but that's ok because I'll improve.
